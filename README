BUILDING:

  Place in the same top-level directory into which you have checked out Embassy
  (or adjust the paths in the Cargo.toml appropriately)

    mydir/embassy
    mydir/clockblink

Adjust .cargo/config.toml to set three build env variables:

 -  CHRONO_TZ_TIMEZONE_FILTER appropriately for your location.
 -  WIFI_SSID to your ssid
 -  WIFI_PASSWORD to your WPA2 wifi password

If you have an open network, you can instead switch the join_wpa2
line to the commented-out join_open line.

in clockblink, run:

    cargo build -r
    elf2uf2-rs target/thumbv6m-none-eabi/release/primeblink primeblink.uf2

And then copy primeblink.uf2 to whereever your rpi-pico w is mounted when you
boot it with the BOOTSEL button pressed. (Or use a debugging setup
and program it appropriately to your config.)
